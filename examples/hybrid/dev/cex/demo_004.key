/**
 * An extreme test for KeYmaera's nested decl capabilities.
 *
 * result: Apart from the fact that a quantified variable couldn't be redeclared,
 * KeYmaera handles nested decl. pretty well. Shown here is 4-levels of nested
 * decl.
 * Also note that a quantified variable could be requantified, and the result is
 * dependent on who is in the innermost scope. As can be seen in this demo, we
 * could have "\forall R y; (\exists R y; y>0)".
