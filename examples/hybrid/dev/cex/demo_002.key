/**
 * The purpose of this file is to discover whether KeYmaera detects parsing issues dealing w/
 * the scope of variables
 *
 * result: KeYmaera doesn't support variable scoping very well. the z in the expression
 * "x+y>z" should have issued a warning w/ z being out of scope. Internally, KeYmaera does
 * notice that z is an undefined symbol after its block ends. For the counterexample engine,
 * we might as well assume that such ill-formed programs are not fed as input.
