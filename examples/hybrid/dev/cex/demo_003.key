/**
 * The purpose of this file is to discover whether KeYmaera supports nested variable decl.
 *
 * result: KeYmaera does support nested decl. and hence care must be taken regarding the value
 * of variables depending on where they stand in the program.
 * As has been observed in the previous demo, KeYmaera doesn't forbit variables that are out of
 * scope, however they have undefined values. But as in other high-level languages, variables that
 * declared to have the same name has their value following that defined in the innermost scope.
