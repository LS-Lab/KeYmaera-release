 * Car stopping for a stop sign - unprovable
 * 
 * In this example, the control for the car does not prevent the car
 * from running the stop sign; however, by looking at branches of the
 * proof which are not true, we may see what properties are required 
 * in the initial conditions and the controller in order to prove safety.
 * 
 * Variable Definitions:
 * x position of car
 * v velocity of car
 * a acceleration of car
 * A max acceleration 
 * B max braking 
 * StopSign position of Stop Sign
 * t time
 * eps max time between discrete control loops
