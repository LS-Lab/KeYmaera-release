/**
 * Essentials of European Train Control System (ETCS).
 * 	A buggy version of the essentials of the ETCS train control protocol. This example (incorrectly) claims that a train in a buggy system never leaves its movement authority (MA=m) and, thus, cannot crash into other trains.
Bug 1: the precondition of the initial state of the system is not strong enough and should be v^2&lt;2*b*(m-z).
Bug 2: The constraint for acceleration is too lax and should be m-z>SB. The bugs can be found during the search with invariants v^2&lt;=2*b*(m-z) and v^2&lt;2*b*(m-z), respectively.
 * @false (insufficient precondition < vs <= and should be > in a:=A case)
