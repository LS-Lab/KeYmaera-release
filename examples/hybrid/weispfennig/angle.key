Angle at circumference vs. angle at center.

For two triangles ABC and ABM where M is the center of the circumcircle of ABC geometry tells us, that the angle between AC and BC equals the half of the angle between AM and BM. Choosing coordinates A = (-a,0), B=(a,0), C = (x0,y0) and M = (0,b). The radius of the circumcircle is determined by c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = x0^2 + (y0^2 - b^2). The angles are encoded into tangents: We construct <ACB=g1+g2 and y0*tan(g1) = a + x0, and y0*tan(g2) = a - x0. By the addition theorem for tangents we know (1-tan(g1)*tan(g2))tan(g1+g2) =tan(g1)+tan(g2). Let z = <AMB/2. Then b*tan(z) = a, and the claim is that tan(z) = tan(g1+g2). The translation phi with t1 = tan(g1), t2 = tan(g2), and t = tan(z) reads as follows:

\functions {
R a;
R b;
R c;
R x0;
R y0;
}

\problem {
	(a != 0 & y0 != 0) -> \forall R x; \forall R t1; \forall R t2; \forall R t; \forall R b; (c^2 = a^2 + b^2 & c^2 = x0^2 + (y0-b)^2 & y0 * t1 = a+x0 & y0*t2 = a - x0 & (1-t1*t2)*t=t1+t2 -> b*t=a)
}
