EXAMPLE 2 (Median Bisector Theorem). For a non-isosceles triangle
ABC the median over the side AB is always greater than the interior
bisector on the same side (see Figure 2). This example and the ideas for its algebraic translation are taken from Wu [29], pp. 7{8. To prove the theorem, we take coordinates such  that A = (;1 0) B = (1 0) C = (x0 y0 ): We may wlog. assume that y0 > 0. Since the origin O = (0 0) is the mid point of AB , we have that CO is the median on AB . We construct the bisector using the geometric theorem proved as Example 1: The center of the circumcicle is at (0 b). Let c > 0 be its radius, then c2 = 1 + b2 , and V = (0 b ; c) is the lower extremity of the circumcicle. Let X = (x 0) be the intersection between CV and AB . Then CX is the interior bisector on the side AB . We come to the following translation phi with parameters x0 and y0 :

	(x0 != 0) -> \forall R b; \forall R c; \forall R x; ((y0 > 0 & c > 0 & c^2 = 1 + b^2 & c^2 = x0^2 + (y0-b)^2 & x*(y0 + (c-b)) = x0*(c-b)) -> x0^2 + y0^2 > (x0 - x)^2 + y0^2)
