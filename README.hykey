HyKeY
-----

HyKeY is a theorem prover for hybrid systems that implements the calculus
for the differential dynamic logic dL. HyKeY is an extension of the KeY
tool with Mathematica and can be used for verifying hybrid systems. It has
been developped in the group of Prof. Ernst-RÃ¼diger Olderog at the
University of Oldenburg.
