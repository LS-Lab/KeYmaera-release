To enable the CSDP support the following software is necessary:
- Csdp (https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/)
- lapack (used by Csdp)
- blas (used by Csdp)

For compiling the Csdp library with CFLAG -fPIC and copy the resulting archive
libsdp.a to system/native/csdp

Now run make in that directory. Make creates a libcsdp.so file which is
required to be in your java library path it will be copied to your binary
directory.
